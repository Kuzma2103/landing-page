## Overview

The project itself don't have any dependencies. I use plain html, javascript for the development process with Sass styling. To see this project (or edit it if you need to), all you need is Visual Studio Code with two extensions - Live Server and Live Sass Compiler. Feel free to use this whatever you like.
